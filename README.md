# S3ID
SDN-based Space Systems Intrusion Detection (S3ID) Dataset

This dataset was generated to validate the utility of the SDN-based Space Systems Framework for Simulations (S3FS) developed in this project. The dataset comprises normal traffic and attack traffic, consisting of three different types of attacks, and it can be used to evaluate Machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Dataset characteristics
### Dataset generation:
- **Normal traffic**: This traffic was generated by transmitting data from the satellites to the ground station over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) using the Netcat network utility.
- **Attack traffic**: Three attacks were used to generate the attack traffic

- ### Size and composition:
