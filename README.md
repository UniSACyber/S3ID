# SDN-based Space Systems Intrusion Detection (S3ID) Dataset

This intrusion detection dataset was generated to validate the utility of the [SDN-based Space Systems Framework for Simulations (S3FS)](https://github.com/UniSACyber/S3FS) developed in this project. The dataset represents data transfer from an Earth observation (EO) Walker-Delta satellite constellation to a ground station for normal traffic over 24 hours with a 60-second interval simulated in MATLAB. To generate the attack traffic, a malicious host is connected to the ground station. The S3ID dataset is suitable for training Machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Dataset characteristics
### Dataset generation:
The EO Walker-Delta satellite constellation orbital dynamics from MATLAB were exported to Mininet to integrate software-defined networking (SDN). Two Oracle VirtualBox virtual machines were set up for Mininet and the SDN POX controller, respectively. The virtual machines communicate via a Host-only network adapter on Oracle VirtualBox. In Mininet, the satellites and the ground station are presented as a coupled Mininet host (e.g. s1 and h1). The diagram below shows the topology configuration.

- **Normal traffic**: This traffic was generated by transmitting data from the satellites to the ground station over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) using the Netcat network utility.
- **Attack traffic**: A malicious host (h25) connected to the ground station generated the attack traffic against the ground station (s0 and h0). Several attacks were used to generate the attack traffic, including a port scan attack and two types of SYN flood attacks, a generic (DoS attack) and a random source flood (DDoS attack), referred to as a SYN flow flood attack in this project.
- The traffic was captured on the POX controller virtual machine as PCAP files using Tcpdump.
- The CICFlowMeter tool was used to extract flow features from the PCAP files to CSV format, which is the S3ID dataset.

### Data features:
All the dataframes consist of 84 flow features and a categorical 'label' column.
- Normal traffic consists of 3129 instances.
- SYN flood (DoS) attack consists of 94,141 instances.
- SYN flow flood (DDoS) attack consists of 2854 instances.
- Port scan attack consists of 817 instances.

## Dataset validation
All the dataframes were combined into one CSV file. To validate the multi-class dataset, three ML-based classifiers were explored, namely, radial basis function kernel (RBF)-Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and k-nearest Neighbor (KNN). Preprocessing steps such as normalisation, feature selection and dataset splitting (80% training and 20% testing) were performed. RF classifier achieved the highest performance with a 0.866 accuracy compared to 0.758 and 0.771 for SVM and KNN, respectively.

## Future work
The S3ID dataset was primarily developed to test and validate [S3FS](https://github.com/UniSACyber/S3FS). S3ID will be continuously updated, and a more comprehensive and extensive dataset will be developed at a later stage. Additionally, simulations of more advanced cyber attacks originating outside the Mininet VM will be performed.
