# SDN-based Space Systems Intrusion Detection (S3ID) Dataset

This intrusion detection dataset was generated to validate the utility of the [SDN-based Space Systems Framework for Simulations (S3FS)](https://github.com/UniSACyber/S3FS) developed in this project. The dataset represents data transfer from an Earth observation (EO) Walker-Delta satellite constellation to a ground station for normal traffic over 24 hours with a 60-second interval simulated in MATLAB. To generate the attack traffic, a malicious host is connected to the ground station. The S3ID dataset is suitable for training Machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Dataset characteristics
### Dataset generation:
- **Normal traffic**: This traffic was generated by transmitting data from the satellites to the ground station over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) using the Netcat network utility.
- **Attack traffic**: Several attacks were used to generate the attack traffic, including a port scan attack and two types of SYN flood attacks, a generic (DoS attack) and random source flood (DDoS attack), referred to as SYN flow flood attack in this project.

The EO Walker-Delta satellite constellation dynamics from MATLAB were exported to Mininet to integrate software-defined networking (SDN). Two Oracle VirtualBox virtual machines were setup for Mininet and SDN POX controller.

- The traffic was captured on the POX controller virtual machine as PCAP files using Tcpdump.
- The CICFlowMeter tool was used to extract flow features from the PCAP files to CSV format, which is the S3ID dataset.

### Data features:
All the dataframes consist of 84 flow features and a categorical 'label' column.
- Normal traffic consists of 3129 instances.
- SYN flood attack consists of 94,141 instances.
- SYN flow flood attack consists of 2854 instances.
- Port scan attack consists of 817 instances.


## Future work
The S3ID dataset was developed to test and validate [S3FS](https://github.com/UniSACyber/S3FS). S3ID will be continuously updated, and a more comprehensive and extensive dataset will be developed at a later stage. Additionally, simulations of more advanced cyber attacks against SDN-based space systems will be performed.
