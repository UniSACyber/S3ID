# S3ID
SDN-based Space Systems Intrusion Detection (S3ID) Dataset

This dataset was generated to validate the utility of the SDN-based Space Systems Framework for Simulations (S3FS) developed in this project. The dataset contains normal traffic generated by transmitting data from the satellites to the ground station over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) using the Netcat
network utility. For the attack traffic, three different types of attacks were generated.
