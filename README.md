# SDN-based Space Systems Intrusion Detection (S3ID) Dataset

This intrusion detection dataset was generated to validate the utility of the [SDN-based Space Systems Framework for Simulations (S3FS)](https://github.com/UniSACyber/S3FS) developed in this project. The dataset represents data transfer from an Earth observation (EO) Walker-Delta satellite constellation to a ground station for normal traffic, and a malicious switch is connected to the ground station to generate attack traffic. The S3ID dataset is suitable for training Machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Dataset characteristics
### Dataset generation:
- **Normal traffic**: This traffic was generated by transmitting data from the satellites to the ground station over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) using the Netcat network utility.
- **Attack traffic**: Several attacks were used to generate the attack traffic, including two types of SYN flood attacks (generic and random source flood, referred to as SYN flow flood in this project) and a port scan attack.


### Data features:
All the dataframes consist of 84 flow features and a categorical 'label' column.
- Normal traffic consists of 3129 instances.
- SYN flood attack consists of 94,141 instances.
- SYN flow flood attack consists of 2854 instances.
- Port scan attack consists of 817 instances.
